<strong>Multi-Enterprise Collaboration</strong> is at the heart of nearly every organization and is essential for an enterprise to become efficient and dynamic. However, effective collaboration can be a challenging task to achieve due to dynamic nature of the business ecosystem. With increasing customer demands, varying trading partner capabilities, resource constraints and ever-changing industry standards and regulations, many businesses find it difficult to discover the right strategy for their large ecosystem of partners, customers and suppliers.

In order to succeed, organizations must connect, integrate and synchronize their extended value chains so, that they may become essential to customers, partners and suppliers. Quickly being being able to adapt to trading partner needs, optimizing supply chains, and constant monitoring, the performance of on-going EDI transactions is required to create the dream On-Demand Enterprise.

With increasing customer demands, varying trading partner capabilities, resource constraints and ever-changing industry standards and regulations, many businesses find it difficult to discover the right strategy for their large ecosystem of partners, customers and suppliers.
