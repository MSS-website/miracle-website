                        The major challenge for the firm was to restructure their Global Integrations to achieve their goal, which was Faster-to-Market using their AS-IS Oracle JCAPS and DECEDI Platforms. The challenge was to reengineer their Business Applications / New Work Definitions (Processes, Procedures and Documentation) while also optimizing the time for developing / monitoring the transactions across their 270 global offices, plus integrating their external customers as well. Miracle helped to solve their challenge by placing a Next Generation Gateway using IBM technology from both Websphere and Sterling Product groups.
