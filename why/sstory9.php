The application also uses third-party software, “Sync Fusion”, for building some custom controls while the Database Layer was built on SQL Server 2008.

                     <p class="methodText">The existing system, which helped them monitor their personnel and assets in a storm situation, was based on Legacy Technology and needed to be re-architecture to leverage the latest web technologies while taking system performance and scalability into consideration. They also needed the application to be able to handle multiple form factors including Mobile and Tablet devices.

                        <li>Handling third party software is a bit expensive at times</li>
                        <li>Performance issues with the existing legacy technology, with lack of scalability</li>
                        <li>Lack of Mobile/IPad compatibility with GeoLocation API</li>

                        <li>The primary change that is required for the new application is the redesign of the database model to a more rational database that avoids data redundancy</li>
                        <li>Allow the Admin user to reset the database to default parameters and providing option for archiving the current storm</li>

                        <li>Can be rewritten in latest technologies with service oriented approach for enabling application access from mobile devices (iPad). Web Services will be used to enable modular design of the application for enabling access from different devices / browsers</li>
