                       With over 500,000 Commercial and Military EDI documents flowing through their B2B systems everyday, they needed a sound system to ensure business excellence for the future. With a fully automated yet legacy-grade system, made up of CLEO MFT, Gentran EDI processes and AIX Korn Shell Scripts, their EDI processing capabilities were sturdy but not enterprise-class. They needed a modern and scalable platform to ensure their business growth for the future.

                        Our expertise in the space of EDI Transformation and MFT Solutions helped us to quickly analyze the existing platform and project a framework-based solution versus the existing piecemeal solution.

                       The highest priority was to give them a consolidated platform with updated technology and skill sets so that their enterprise could sustain growth for the future. With vast experience in B2B platform consolidation and migrations, it wouldn’t be a problem to migrate them from the Legacy GIS systems to IBM Sterling B2B Integrator. The challenge was to solve their visibility and control problem as well.

                       It is absolutely critical for logistics providers and Supply Chain Managers to have a great amount of visibility and control over their daily EDI transactions. That is exactly what we provide through our <strong><a class="linkText" href="http://www.miraclesoft.com/scvp">Supply Chain Visibility Portal</a></strong>.We were able to implement the portal in no time on top of Sterling Integrator, which enabled them to use the self-service portal to view and control their huge number of EDI transactions.
