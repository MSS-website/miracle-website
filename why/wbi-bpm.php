               Our customer receives an average of 150,000 faxes from their retail partner annually for special orders. These orders are then keyed into a Quoting Tool manually, which leads to order entry errors, misinterpretation and instability of the faxing infrastructure. When their exclusive retail partner changed their Quoting Tool, our customer also had to integrate with the new tool and receive orders in the form of EDI documents.
          </p>
           <p class="methodText">
        The customer wanted to use BPM, IBM WebSphere Process Server in order to receive order details from their B2B system, and then orchestrate/transform/route them to the Quoting System for creating a quote. With BAAN 5.0 as their ERP, our team helped the customer migrate their ICS interfaces for applications specific to Manufacturing, with a new design in BPM v7.5.
