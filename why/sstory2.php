                        Miracle enabled customer in processing clinical information received in HL7 format from its plane sponsors and translated clinical information to their Proprietary format. Translation was done using Mercator and deployment of runtime components was done on AIX. There were various interfaces using Mercator to transform data from one format to another and to load the data into the DB using Database Adapter. Miracle followed MSDM (Miracle Software Development Methodology) designed with vast experience in application development and support. This methodology was modeled on the basis of Rational Unified Process and Agile methodologies taking the best out of these two standards.
