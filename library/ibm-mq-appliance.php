                       As today’s enterprise becomes much more connected, messaging plays a crucial role in ensuring that your connected architecture is flexible, simple and reliable. After years of dominance in the Messaging and Connectivity space, this February IBM announced the arrival of MQ v8.0 in the form factor of a physical appliance. The MQ Appliance brings great aspects such as simplicity, scalability, security, rapid and remote deployment, and also high availability through paired appliances.

                     With MQ being used in a software based approach for so many implementations, the whole idea of the appliance prompts questions regarding the advantages and value of moving to an appliance based deployment model for messaging.
                
                 <strong>Some of the prime advantages and deployment options for the new MQ Appliance are, </strong>
                 <ul>
                     <li>With a dedicated appliance your messaging footprint is simpler and smaller</li>
                     <li>Easier administration with separated roles and MQ Console Tool(Browser Based)</li>
                     <li>Pre-Optimized Hardware for highest and optimum performance</li>
                     <li>Certified firmware updates from IBM for both MQ and firmware</li>
                     <li>Lower data center costs, space usage and power requirements</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Appliance uses a Hub-Based pattern, which means that applications must connect as remote clients</li>
                        <li>No user exits can be run on the appliance and monitoring must be done with remote monitoring agents</li>
                        <li>Shared file systems and disks are not required for providing MQ Appliance</li>
                        <li>All firmware updates are done through single installable fix packs which are certified by IBM</li>
