                <p class="methodText"> One of the most important use cases of the sensor data would be to inform the Facility Manager of any anomalies in the facilities conditions. This is achieved by taking the data into <strong>NodeRed</strong> and creating an orchestration to test the data and notify the manager.</p>
                <ul>
                <li> NodeRed takes the data and executes a defined test on the temperature and humidity data coming from the sensors</li>
                <li>When an anomaly is detected the data is passed to a Bluemix Service such as <strong>Twilio</strong> (or) <strong>Twitter</strong></li>
                <li>These services then take the data and send a defined message to the Facility Manager about the anomaly</li>
                <li>The Facility Manager can then see this as a Push Notification, Email, Twitter Feed (or) Twilio Message and act accordingly</li>
                <li>Simultaneously the notification and anomaly data is also sent over to a NoSQL DB such as <strong>Cloudant</strong> for Persistence</li>

                <p class="methodText"> Even though anomaly notification is vital, historical sensor data is equally important for dash boarding and analytics. The second use case would be to take this sensor data and persist it into a data store to enable the Facility Manager to do the following,</p>
                <ul>
                <li> Query the NoSQL DB and check historical data and anomalies</li>
                <li>Apply Analytics to the data to check for patterns and predict outcomes</li>
                <li>Dashboard real-time sensor data for monitoring of the facility</li>

               <p class="methodText">Using Bluemix and its Node.JS Runtime, developers can create Mobile Apps that Facility Managers can use to check for notifications, real-time data feeds and also take action by controlling facility equipment.</p>
