In such a demanding environment, its is very important for organizations to be able to make changes in a agile and flexible manner, else risk being displaced by a competitor who got it right.</p>

                    <div class="row">

                    </div>
                    <p class="methodText"> <strong>Continuous Integration </strong> (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily and can also receive constant feedback on the status of the code.</p>
                    <p class="methodText"><strong> Jenkins</strong> is an open-source continuous integration software tool written in the Java programming language for testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time. It helps to enables developers to find and solve defects in a code base rapidly and to automate testing of their builds.</p>

                    <p class="methodText">In software development, team members spend weeks , months (or) even longer, verifying that their applications work just prior to releasing them. That time spent “integrating” changes is frequently torturous. Developers would kill to have an automated process to help track bugs made over the past few months in a large code base.</p>
                    <p class="methodText">An enormous amount of time is wasted trying to merge incompatible changes from different developers, which ultimately lead to storms of constantly broken builds and applications. A good version control system can help to shed some light on the nature of the bugs encountered during integration, but frequently fixing these incompatibilities is a horror story.</p>
                    <p class="methodText">Bad memory of developers, not so good commit comments and lack of versioning the integrations is not a good practice for emerging Digital Enterprise.<strong> Such a system can restrict innovation, collaboration, flexibility and agility of an enterprise. <font color="#ef4048">This is a RED LIGHT for any Digital Enterprise. </font> </strong></p>

                    <p class="methodText">Many Integration Developers have the same difficulties in making rapid changes to Integration Flows in IBM’s Integration Bus as well. The lack of collaboration between Dev and Ops can make a small change expand to a 2-month project.</p>
                     <p class="methodText">In our solution, we use Jenkins, Git and Ant, to automate the versioning, deployment and testing of an Integration Flow. This helps to promote collaborative changes, smaller change cycles, and rapid testing and deployment of changes.</p>
