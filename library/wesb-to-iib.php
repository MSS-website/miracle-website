                       For any enterprise that wants to become connected yet flexible, an ESB is always a must to ensure that all its parts are talking with each other in a scalable model. Putting connectivity as a major factor for an enterprises excellence, IBM has brought together WebSphere MB and its own Enterprise Service Bus to deliver a universal integration backbone, IBM Integration Bus. Through IBM, IIB is an enterprise that can experience the best-of-both worlds with enhanced functionality.

                         With that being taken into consideration, IBM has announced the end of support for WebSphere ESB by April 2018, which means the time is now ripe to set the tone for migration to a much more powerful, future-oriented and universal solution for your connected enterprise. With IBM Integration Bus, IBM’s endeavor to enable enterprise connectivity through a single integration solution has come true.

               Absolutely! IBM is even giving customers free transfer options for your WESB licenses, along with the WESB Conversion Tool which ensures that you have a quick, seamless and peaceful migration to IBM Integration Bus.

               With IBM Integration Bus being allowed in two unique models, you can opt for either one during your conversion process. You can either migrate to the original IIB model with comparable scalability and capability (or) choose the IIB Advanced mode with high availability(Active/Idle Parts) and advanced adapters and features included.
